# 3D Rasterization Engine
A rasterization rendering engine written from scratch in C++ with a custom-built entity component system. Open to extension for a physics engine to create a dynamic world.

# Current Capabilities & Limitations
Currently, the engine is able to render objects and the user is able to move around the objects. We have also implemented triangle culling and other optimization techniques to increase rendering speed. However, the rasterization math is messing up somewhere which leads to strange distortions when the user is moving.
